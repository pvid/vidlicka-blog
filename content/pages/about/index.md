My name is Pavol Vidliƒçka, An aspiring T-shaped developer interested in Big Data, distributed systems, databases and query languages.

I am currently employed at seznam.cz, working day-to-day with technologies like Spark, Hadoop, Hive, HBase, etc. while creating and maintaining complex data pipelines.

I studied Mathematics, which gives me a bit different perspective than someone from a computer science background. Automatic theorem provers (a.k.a type systems), probability distributions, matrices and self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces do not scare me. My Master's thesis [has been published](https://www.aimspress.com/article/10.3934/math.2019.5.1466).
