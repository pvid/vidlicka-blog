My name is Pavol Vidliƒçka. I am a developer interested in Big Data and distributed systems.

I am currently employed at Seznam.cz, working day-to-day with technologies like Spark, Hadoop, Hive and HBase to create and maintain complex data pipelines.

I studied Mathematics, which influences how I see computer science. Type systems, probability distributions, matrices or even self-adjoint operators do not scare me. In the past, I have done research on qualitative theory of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations. My Master's thesis on the subject [has been published](https://www.aimspress.com/article/10.3934/math.2019.5.1466) in a peer-reviewed journal.
